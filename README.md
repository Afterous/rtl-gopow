# rtl-gopow
Render tables from rtl_power to a nice heat map
Here is an render of rtl_power tool scanning 80-90 MHz during 2.5 hours moving in a car. ![80-90 MHz](http://i.imgur.com/knkzLXO.jpg).

# Availability
Since Go is easy to cross compile, this tool can be easily distributed as a binary without any dependencies. You'll find it under Releases here on github. The following platforms are avalible as a ready to run binary file:

* OS X (x64)
* Linux (x64)
* Linux (arm5)
* Linux (arm7)
* Windows (x64)

## Performance
A render of a 600 MB csv file takes about 2 minutes on a 2,4 GHz Intel Core i5. There is still lots of room for improvement on that though. Memory usage is quite horrid.

## Options
```

   --input, -i      CSV input file generated by rtl_power [required]
   --output, -o     Output file, default same as input file with new extension
   --format, -f 'png'   Output file format, default png [png,jpeg]
